# selector.cr
This is a very simple utility, intended for command line use, that accepts via command line or STDIN a set of data items, and then displays them, one per line, with checkboxes next to them, and the ability to move through them, selecting or deselecting them with the keyboard. When enter is pressed, the selected set it returned to STDOUT.
